# spring-boot-bom

This is the source of `dev.mbo:spring-boot-bom`. This is meant for typical projects based on spring boot with various
other libraries that don't come with spring boot itself.

## Note for gradle config for publishing:

```shell
cat ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
# signing.keyId=<last8chars>
# signing.password=<key_password>
# signing.secretKeyRingFile=<home>/.gnupg/secring.gpg
# 
# ossrhUsername=<jira-username>
# ossrhPassword=<jira-password>
```

- **keyId** are the last 8 chars of the key to use from gpg -K.
- **password** is the password for that key and
- **secretKeyRingFile** full qualified path to the keyring generated by the command below

list existing keys:

```shell
gpg --list-secret-keys
```

generate keyring file (replace the $KEY_ID with the id of the key to use):

```shell
gpg --keyring secring.gpg --export-secret-keys $KEY_ID > ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg
```

hint: using `~/.gnupg/secring.gpg` in the gradle.properties doesn't work. replace ~ with the full path.

## Steps for release

For example this prepares a release of 1.0.0 and a development version of 1.0.1-SNAPSHOT.
Do NOT run it with the sample versions. This needs to be updated on every run.

```shell
./gradlew release -Prelease.useAutomaticVersion=true -Prelease.releaseVersion=1.0.0 -Prelease.newVersion=1.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

You can skip `-Prelease.releaseVersion=1.0.0 -Prelease.newVersion=1.0.1-SNAPSHOT` to release the snapshot and
autoincrement.
